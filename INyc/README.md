#Read ME for INyc

INyc is a website/application that introduces you to what New York has always been
a place for the arts, great food, and unique events. Creating something that represents
not only my interests but my past. As an artist, a chef, and a curator sharing these
aspects of the city keeps the culture moving forward.

#Front End
Now about the process. Using React, tailwinds, css, and Javascipt to bring the frontend 
to life. React as a tool for user interaction throughout the page. Creating routes to connect
each page so that the experience is fluid and without a hitch. 

#Back End
Spring boot, java, MySql, and Node.js to propogate information into a database to create an API.
Taking data created by user accounts to utilize the CRUD process.
